  rows:
  - actionId: WanderAction
    prompt: You are wandering, endlessly playing out the agonistic game of your search.
      Rules translate the pain of violent conflict into the pleasures of disputation,
      but there is no win condition for you, only the cost of the next action.
  - actionId: RestAction
    prompt: You are attempting to rest but can find no peace as your mind attempts
      to understand the source of your cycle of pain. You have no choice but to restlessly
      continue.
  - actionId: WorkAction
    prompt: You are in massive debt.
  - actionId: EatAction
    prompt: You are insatiably hungry.
